# StandaloneWarpDrivePatches

### Features
- Add two patches for [Interstellar Warp Drive standalone](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/KSP-WarpDrive/releases "haha why you mouse over there"), one add a warp drive QBE for Standalone, one allow the warp drive to change mass (warp power). For 0.93 or below since 0.94 change module name.
- notice that Standalone Warp Drive is inherently incompatible with USI warp system as standalone hijack the exotic matter storage that usi resource converter
couldn't generate EM. Therefore patch is not possible for them.

### Dependencies
[B9PartSwitch](https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9PartSwitch/releases/)
